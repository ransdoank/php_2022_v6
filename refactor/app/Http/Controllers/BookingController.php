    // -------------------------------------------
    // What Makes It OK:
    //     - Dependency Injection: The practice of injecting dependencies is being followed, which is great for decoupling, testability, and adhering to the - SOLID principles.
    //     - Clean Constructor: The constructor is simple and its purpose is clear â€“ to inject the BookingRepository.

    // Improve:
    //     - Property Type Declaration: With PHP 7.4 and later versions, you can declare types for class properties, which helps with ensuring the correct type is always used and can make the code more self-documenting.
    //     - Visibility Best Practices: Depending on how the $repository property is used within subclasses or if you plan to allow modifications from child classes, you might want to consider making it private instead of protected to enforce encapsulation.
    //     - PHPDoc Comments: The current comment block is quite minimal. Expanding the PHPDoc comments can be helpful, especially to explain the purpose of the BookingRepository and any wider context that it might be useful for other developers to know.
    //     - Use of Laravel Features: In Laravel, you can accomplish much of what this controller is doing simply by typing-hinting in the method signatures instead of defining properties and injecting through the constructor, if that fits the usage pattern.

    // Here is how you could potentially improve it:
    /**
     * The repository for handling bookings operations.
     *
     * @var BookingRepository
     */
    private BookingRepository $repository;


    /**
     * BookingController constructor.
     * @param BookingRepository $bookingRepository
     */

    public function __construct(BookingRepository $bookingRepository)
    {
        $this->repository = $bookingRepository;
    }

    /**
     * @param Request $request
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        // if($user_id = $request->get('user_id')) {

        //     $response = $this->repository->getUsersJobs($user_id);

        // }
        // elseif($request->__authenticatedUser->user_type == env('ADMIN_ROLE_ID') || $request->__authenticatedUser->user_type == env('SUPERADMIN_ROLE_ID'))
        // {
        //     $response = $this->repository->getAll($request);
        // }

        // return response($response);
        // -------------------------------------------
        // Issues:
        //     - Direct Environment Variable Access: Accessing the env function directly in the code outside of configuration files is not recommended as it only works when the configuration is not cached. It's better to use configuration files with Laravel.
        //     - Implicit Authentication Check: The code accesses a property __authenticatedUser on the $request, which is not a standard Laravel property and implies that authentication logic might be scattered throughout the application.
        //     - Error Handling: The method lacks error handling. If no user_id is provided and the authenticated user is not an admin, it's not clear what $response would contain.
        //     - Clarification of Business Logic: The conditionals slightly obfuscate the business logic, making it less clear at a glance what the method is supposed to do.
        //     - Response Standardization: It provides no standardized way to handle cases where no data is found or no user ID is given, and there's no admin to return all jobs.

        // Improvements:
        //     - Configuration Usage: Use Laravel's configuration system to reference roles. Set these in a config file that references environment variables.
        //     - Middleware Integration: Utilize middleware for authentication to clarify the flow and offload the responsibility from the controller.
        //     - Exception Handling: Properly handle cases of unauthorized access and missing parameters.
        //     - Type-Hinting: Leverage form requests for validation and authorization.

        // Here is a revised version of the method:
        if ($request->filled('user_id')) {
            $response = $this->repository->getUsersJobs($request->input('user_id'));
        } else {
            $user = $request->user(); // Use Laravel's built-in method to retrieve the authenticated user.
            
            if (in_array($user->user_type, config('auth.admin_roles'), true)) {
                $response = $this->repository->getAll($request);
            } else {
                return response()->json(['error' => 'Not authorized.'], 403);
            }
        }
    
        return response()->json($response);
    }

    /**
     * @param $id
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function show($id)
    {
        // $job = $this->repository->with('translatorJobRel.user')->find($id);

        // return response($job);

        // -------------------------------------------
        // Positive Aspects:
        //     - Simplicity: The method is straightforward, retrieving a job using its ID, then returning it. The simplicity allows for easy interpretation and debugging.
        //     - Utilizing Repository: Leveraging a repository to encapsulate data logic abstracts the controller from the data layer, making the codebase more maintainable.
        //     - Eager Loading: By using with('translatorJobRel.user'), the method performs eager loading to retrieve related models, which can help reduce the number of database queries and improve performance.

        // Improvement:
        //     - Error Handling: There's no apparent error handling if no job is found for the given $id. If find returns null, the method will still try to return a response, which may not be the intended behavior.
        //     - Response Standardization: It does not standardize the response format or the HTTP status code, which is important for API consistency, especially in error scenarios.
        //     - Method Documentation: The PHPDoc comment does not accurately describe the parameter $id or what "mixed" means for the return type. More specific documentation would be beneficial.
        //     - Type Safety: There is no type hinting for the $id parameter, which means that the method could be called with any type of variable.

        // Refactored Code with Improvements:
        $job = $this->repository->with('translatorJobRel.user')->find($id);

        if (!$job) {
            // Assuming a job not found should return a 404 not found response.
            return response()->json(['message' => 'Job not found.'], 404);
        }

        // $data = $request->all();

        // $response = $this->repository->store($request->__authenticatedUser, $data);

        // return response($response);

        // -------------------------------------------
        // What's Generally OK:
        //     - Conciseness: The method is concise which generally simplifies understanding and maintenance.
        //     - Indentation and Style: It follows PHP's PSR (PHP Standards Recommendations) styling norms which promote readability.
        //     - Using a Repository: The usage of a repository is positive for abstracting business logic away from the controller.

        // Improvement:
        //     - Validation: The code lacks validation for the incoming request data. Without validation, there is a risk of persisting invalid or even harmful data.
        //     - Security: The method uses $request->all(), which blindly accepts all parameters passed in the request. This approach leaves the application vulnerable to mass-assignment attacks unless guarded appropriately in the model.
        //     - Authentication: Like in other code snippets you provided, it accesses a non-standard property __authenticatedUser on the request object. This isn't a conventional part of the Laravel request and might imply custom modifications or middleware that aren't clear within the context of the code, potentially impacting maintainability and clarity.
        //     - Error Handling: If the store operation fails for any reason, such as a database error, the method does not seem to handle this case.
        //     - Documentation: The doc comment indicates a return type of mixed, which lacks specificity. Detailed return type information could be beneficial. Additionally, there is no indication of what kind of response is returned on success or failure.
        //     - State Change Via GET Method: It's not explicitly clear, but if store is intended to be used with an HTTP GET method, that would be incorrect. This method should be reserved for POST requests since it changes the state of the application by adding a new resource.

        // Improved Code:
        $validatedData = $request->validate([
            // Define your validation rules here, for example:
            'title' => 'required|max:255',

        ]);

            $response = $this->repository->store($user, $validatedData);
            
            return response()->json($response); // Assume $response is appropriate for the client
        } catch (\Exception $e) {

        // return response($response);

        // -------------------------------------------
        // Improvement:
        //     - Security: The method utilizes $request->all() to retrieve input data, which could expose the application to mass-assignment vulnerabilities. Even though the array_except function is used to remove the _token and submit fields, an allowlist approach (explicitly defining the fields that can be updated) is usually safer.
        //     - Authentication: The code accesses an unconventional property __authenticatedUser, which isn't part of the standard Laravel Request object. This indicates there might be custom middleware adding this property, but the method lacks clarity without it being explicit in the code.
        //     - Validation: The method lacks input validation, which is necessary to ensure the integrity of incoming data before it is processed.
        //     - Error Handling: There is an absence of error handling if, for example, the updateJob method fails or the job with the specified $id doesn't exist.
        //     - Return Type Documentation: The PHPDoc block only defines the return type as mixed, which is not very informative. It would be beneficial to specify what kinds of responses can be expected.
        //     - Deprecation: The array_except function was removed as of Laravel 6.x. If you are using a recent version of Laravel, this would result in an error.

        // -------------------------------------------
        // What's OK:
        //     - Use of Configuration: The $adminSenderEmail is fetched from the application configuration, which is good practice for easy management of such settings.
        //     - Repository Utilization: The usage of a repository helps in abstracting the logic from the controller, keeping the code clean.

        // Improvement:
        //     - Unused Variable: The $adminSenderEmail variable is defined but not used in this method. This is dead code and should be removed if it's indeed not used.
        //     - Validation: The method lacks validation checks. Directly using $request->all() fetches all user input, which could lead to mass-assignment vulnerabilities or the inclusion of unexpected/bad data.
        //     - Error Handling: There are no error checks. If storeJobEmail fails, there's no indication of how the system would respond.
        //     - Response Handling: The method assumes a successful operation and returns $response directly, without considering the various types of HTTP responses that could be applicable based on the operation's result.
        //     - Documentation: The PHPDoc block could be more specific about what the method returns (the return type is merely listed as mixed).
        //     - Handling of Admin Email: It's unclear why the $adminSenderEmail is fetched since it's not used in the visible code, which may suggest incomplete implementation.

        // -------------------------------------------
        // What's OK:
        //     - Simplicity: The method's logic is straightforwardâ€”if a user_id is provided in the request, it will fetch the user's jobs history.
        //     - Condition Check: It performs a condition check to see if the user_id exists, which is a good practice to validate the presence of required parameters.

        // Improvement:
        //     - Unclear Return Type: The method's PHPDoc comment specifies a mixed return type, which does not give clarity into what the caller should expectâ€”will it return an HTTP response or just data?
        //     - Assignment in Conditional: It's using an assignment within an if statement (if($user_id = $request->get('user_id'))), which can be a point of confusion and potential bugs, as it may be mistaken for an equality check.
        //     - Loose Validation: The code doesn't perform strict validation of the user_id parameter aside from checking its existence. This can result in unexpected behavior or more serious security issues if improper input is passed.
        //     - Inconsistent Return Types: The method returns a response object if a user's job history is found, but returns null if no user_id is provided. This inconsistency can lead to confusion for the client of this API.
        //     - Error Handling: There is no error handling for cases where the user_id is invalid or doesn't correspond to a user in the system.
        //     - Redundant Request Passing: The method passes the entire $request object to the repository method even though only user_id seems required, which could be unnecessary or risky if not handled properly within the repository method.

        // Improvement:
        //     - Definition of __authenticatedUser: The code uses $request->__authenticatedUser, which is non-standard for Laravel. A cleaner approach would use $request->user() to get the authenticated user, assuming appropriate middleware is in place.
        //     - Lack of Validation: The method uses $request->all() to retrieve all the request data without validation. This can be insecure as it may facilitate mass-assignment vulnerabilities, and the method does not verify the integrity of the input data.

        //     - Poor Documentation: The PHPDoc comment indicates a mixed return type, which is ambiguous. More specific comments are needed for clarity, including describing the data expected in $request.
        //     - Inconsistent Response Handling: The method provides no HTTP status code context or content type - it could return different types of response bodies, potentially making it harder for clients to handle the response correctly.
        //     - Clarity and Maintenance: The method doesn't check for the presence of necessary parameters (e.g., job ID) before proceeding with the operation, implying that it might not be robust against different cases of input.

        // - PHPDoc Ambiguity: The PHPDoc comment indicates a return type of mixed, which lacks specificity. Better documentation could indicate what types of values it returns and under what conditions.

        // Improvement:
        //     - Lack of Validation: The code does not validate the jobid obtained from the request. Itâ€™s assumed to exist and be correct, which might not always be the case, thus potentially causing errors down the line.
        //     - Potential for NotFoundException: The find method may return null if there's no match for the jobid, but the subsequent call to jobToData does not handle this scenario. If job is null, an attempt to process it further could result in errors.
        //     - Error Handling: There's no explicit error handling or response differentiation based on the success or failure of the underlying methods.
        //     - Magic Value: The wildcard ' * ' being passed to sendNotificationTranslator could be considered a magic value since its purpose isn't clear from the context.
        //     - Hard-coded Success Message: The response indicates success regardless of the actual outcome of the notification send operation.
        //     - Response Format: A string array ['success' => 'Push sent'] is used to signal operation success, but HTTP status codes are more suitable for conveying the result's nature.

        // - Fail-Silently Approach: The code is structured to send the exception message directly to the client. This may unintentionally expose internal system details to the end-user or potential attackers and should be avoided.
        // - Lack of Job Existence Check: There is no check for whether $job is null after calling find. If the jobid does not exist, it will lead to a server-side error when trying to use the $job variable.
        // - Response Type: The PHPDoc indicates a complex return type that includes both a Laravel and Symfony response type. While this could just be due to Laravel's facade pattern, a cleaner indication of what is actually being returned (usually a JSON response) might be preferable.
